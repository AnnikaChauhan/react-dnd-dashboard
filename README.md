# Drag and Drop Dashboard

This project is to test out the drag and drop library: https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout

## Notes

- We want to store the layout and also the cards in use, so we need that layout object and a cards object with the attached key and details

## Requirements

- Must be able to use and disable drag and drop
- Must be able to use and disable resizable
- Different compact types available
- Saveable
- Can be used with our own custom components (e.g. MUI)
- Responsive
